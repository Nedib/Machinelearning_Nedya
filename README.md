# Maskinlearning_Machinelearning_Nedya

The course provides me with an introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) by presenting important concepts. I will explore basic models for predicting unknown values, clustering data points, creating self-learning decision trees, and understanding the fundamentals of artificial neural networks. The goal is for me to be able to explain and apply algorithms for training and inference of AI models, as well as learn common methods for data processing and AI infrastructure, including techniques for model evaluation.
During the course, I will work with various technologies and tools to implement and analyze machine learning models. These include:

- Visual Studio Code
- Git/GitHub
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Visualization tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly By gaining experience with these tools and technologies, I will develop a solid foundation for working with machine learning and AI in various contexts.
